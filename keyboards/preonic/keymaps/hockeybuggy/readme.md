# The Preonic layout of Douglas Anderson

Largely based on the default Preonic keymap. It is a US English keyboard
derivative. The big difference between this and the default layout is that the
"Lower" layer emits numbers while the "Raise" layer emits symbols. This change
was done so that the location of the symbol on the keycap would be a mnemonic
to remember (e.g. The "1" is Lower than the "!").
